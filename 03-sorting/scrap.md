Understanding sorting
is a gateway
to mastering
advanced algorithms.

Swaping two values
in an array
is part of sorting.

Selection sort
finds the next lowest
and swaps it
with the next index.

The part that takes the longest
is finding each next smallest

On large arrays
this would perform poorly.
